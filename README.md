This repository contains the evaluation code and dataset for our paper "Evaluation of Image Person Removal Tasks: When Data Synthesis Encounters 3D Reconstruction".

# Synthesized Dataset
Please use BaiduDisk to download the dataset. There are four types of datasets here:\
The virtual synthesis dataset VS_3d_500 of manually collected 3D reconstructed characters consists of 500 images. Link:[VS_3d_500](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1x-aiuX5OS-nKZXCECqNRVw?pwd=je92)\
The fully automated multi angle lighting 3D reconstruction character virtual synthesis dataset VS_3d_7500 consists of 7500 images. Link:[VS_3d_7500](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1bkHJarOqNm1LlZfZ7TKUZw?pwd=tf4k)\
The optimal lighting virtual synthesis dataset VS_3dBL_500, generated through critical search based on VS_3d_7500, consists of 500 images. Link:[VS_3dBL_500](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zop6WjKXx37bYAVD-oZnZA?pwd=j1cj)\
Based on the VS_3d_500 dataset, a coordinated lighting virtual synthesis dataset VS_3dH_500 was generated through an image coordination network, consisting of 500 images. Link:[VS_3dH_500](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-cLuTHrH_TmHbvSTgSVAsQ?pwd=dwv7)\
All datasets are divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio.
